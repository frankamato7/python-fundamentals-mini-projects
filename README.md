# AI Automation Roadmap – What I Learned So Far

## Overview
This repo contains everything I have learned on my AI automation roadmap self-taught journey:
- Following a 10-module AI automation roadmap
- Each module has lessons with code, notebooks, and mini-projects

## Module Index
- [Module 1 – Python Fundamentals](module-01-python-fundamentals/README.md)
- [Module 2 – Intermediate Python + Data Handling](module-02-intermediate-python-data/README.md)
- [Module 3 - APIs, Web Requests, and Python Automation](module-03-apis-automation/README.md) 

## What I Learned So Far

### Python & Core Programming
- Writing and running Python scripts (VS Code + Terminal)
- Variables, user input, casting, arithmetic, conditionals, loops
- Data structures: lists, dicts, sets, tuples
- Functions, modules, imports, basic debugging
- File I/O: read, write, append, existence and size checks 

### NumPy & pandas
- 1D & 2D arrays, shapes, indexing, vectorized math, stats
- Loading CSVs into DataFrames, filtering, sorting, groupby, merges
- Handling missing values, joins, multi-aggregation
- Building a full Data Explorer workflow over a retail dataset 

### SQL & Pipelines
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- INNER JOIN across `sales` and `products`
- Revenue by category, product, and day
- Running SQL inside Python using `pd.read_sql_query`
- Building a SQL → pandas → visualization → CSV pipeline 

### Git & Workflow
- Staging, committing, pushing, rebasing
- Clean repo structure and project-level READMEs
- Organizing by modules and lessons for a long-term learning roadmap 

### APIs & HTTP
- Making HTTP GET requests with Python
- Using the requests library
- Parsing and navigating JSON responses
- Calling multiple public APIs
- Extracting nested dictionaries from real-world API responses

(You can compress/trim as you go, but this is a solid starting shape.)

Going forward, at the end of each session we’ll just add/update bullets in these sections rather than maintaining a separate doc.
